	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. A lower time complexity generally means the algorithm is more efficient. Understanding time complexity is essential for writing scalable programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> defines the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that uses linear space will have a space complexity of O(n).
